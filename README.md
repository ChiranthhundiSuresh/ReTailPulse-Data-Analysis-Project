# ReTailPulse-Data-Analysis-Project
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of retail sales trends, customer segmentation, and the impact of external factors such as seasons and holidays on purchases. The analysis was performed using Python and Tableau to uncover actionable insights and build interactive dashboards.

# Project Overview
### Objective
The project aims to:

1. Analyze sales trends and identify high-performing and low-performing categories.
2. Segment customers based on purchasing behavior.
3. Assess the impact of external factors (e.g., weather, seasons, holidays) on sales.
4. Provide actionable recommendations for inventory and marketing optimization.
   
# Project Workflow
### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Removed duplicates and standardized column names.
Handled missing values through imputation.
Encoded categorical features (e.g., Frequency of Purchases) for analysis.
Integrated external data, including weather conditions and holiday information.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Examined sales trends by category, location, and season.
Visualized seasonal and weather impacts on purchasing behavior.
Segmented customers using clustering techniques (K-Means).

### 3. Advanced Analytics
Regression Analysis: Identified key sales drivers, including Age, Review Rating, and Purchase Frequency.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Calculated high-value customers for targeted marketing.
Forecasting: Predicted future sales using Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing.

### 4. Visualizations
Built an interactive dashboard in Python (Plotly Dash) for insights on:
Seasonal sales trends.
Customer segmentation.
Weather and campaign impact on sales.
Created an interactive Tableau dashboard for:
Customer segmentation.
Sales trends by category and season.
External factor analysis.
